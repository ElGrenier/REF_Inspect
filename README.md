# REF_Inspect
This Inspect script is a REFramework-compatible (REF) script for listing item location details for use in an Archipelago-compatible (AP) randomizer. There is an RE2R AP randomizer in development currently, and this script functions on both RE2R and RE3R.

Currently, RE7 / RE8 / RE4R are not supported, but goal is to get support for each of these as well at some point. There are some notes at the top of the Inspect script on possible leads for adding this support.

Output from this script is listed in the debug console.

## How to Use

1. Install [REFramework](https://github.com/praydog/REFramework) for your game of choice. 
2. Launch the game and at any time, in the REFramework window, go to the "ScriptRunner" tab and click the "Spawn Debug Console" button to open the debug console.
3. In that same "ScriptRunner" tab, click the "Run script" button and navigate to the location of the Inspect.lua script.
